# Verilog Libraries for Basys 3.

I'm studying Electrical Engineering including digital circuits.

I've been working on FPGA projects and this repository contains common code to common digital circuit like 7 segment decoder and digit mux.

** Note: I advice you to write your own code but you can use this as a pin assignment reference or self study reference. Library is meant to avoid repetitivity but not to take shortcut. **
